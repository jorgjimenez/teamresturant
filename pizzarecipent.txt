step to make it
Make the Dough
-Gather the ingredients.
-Combine flour, salt, and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Mix to combine.
-Add water and mix to combine.
-Then, knead dough on low speed for 10 minutes. The mixture should come together into a unified mass that barely sticks to the bottom of the bowl as it kneads. If dough sticks, add flour 1 tablespoon at a time to the mixer while it is running, until the mass barely sticks to the bowl. If the mixture is too dry, add water 1 tablespoon at a time to the running mixer.
-Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 8 hours. It can be refrigerated for up to 72 hours.
-When ready to make pizza, transfer dough to a floured work surface. Divide dough into four even sections.
-Coat four small containers or bowls with nonstick cooking spray or olive oil.
-With floured hands, form each section into a ball.
-Place one dough ball into each coated container or bowl. Lightly spray the top of each dough ball with nonstick cooking spray or coat with olive oil.
-Cover each container or bowl tightly with plastic wrap, and let rise at room temperature for 2 hours. Each dough ball should double in volume.

Make the Sauce
-Gather the ingredients.
-Make the sauce by either pushing the tomatoes through a food mill or simply pulsing them in a food processor until a chunky liquid is formed.
-Heat oven to at least 475 F,  higher if your oven allows. If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat as well.

Assemble the Pizzas
-Gather the ingredients.
-Onto a well-floured surface, stretch out each ball of dough into a 10-inch circle. Use a floured rolling pin if you need it. Don’t worry about the dough being a perfect circle!
-Place one rolled out piece of dough onto a lightly floured pizza peel, shake gently to ensure that the dough is not sticking.
-Spread about 1/3 cup of sauce over the dough, leaving about a 1/2-inch edge without sauce.
-Top the sauce with a quarter of the mozzarella slices. Tear a few basil leaves on top (according to your liking), and drizzle with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. You can also add the basil and olive oil after the pizza is cooked.
-Transfer pizza from peel to the hot stone.
-Bake about 5 to 7 minutes, until cheese is bubbly and crust is charred in places.
-Repeat with remaining dough balls and ingredients.
