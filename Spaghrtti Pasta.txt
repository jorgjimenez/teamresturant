Spaghetti Pasta Alla Carbonara

-------------------------------------Description--------------------------------------

Spaghetti pasta alla carbonara. Luscious and wonderfully indulgent, pasta carbonara takes as long to make as it does to cook the pasta. The ingredients are simple—just spaghetti (or other long pasta), and the carbonara is made with pancetta or bacon, eggs, Parmesan, a little olive oil, salt and pepper.

------------------------------------Ingredients---------------------------------------

* 100g pancetta
* 50g pecorino cheese
* 50g parmesan
* 3 large eggs
* 350g spaghetti
* 2 plump garlic cloves, peeled and left whole
* 50g unsalted butter
* sea salt and freshly grated black pepper

-------------------------------------Method------------------------------------------

1 - Cook the spaghetti. Bring a large, deep panof salted water to the boil. Plunge 400g spaghetti into the water, stir well and cook, following pack instructions. Aim for 'al dente': cooked, but retaining some bite in the middle. Take a few strands out of the water with a spaghetti spoon or tongs 1-2 mins before the end of the cooking time and bite into it. Repeat until you think it is properly cooked.

2 - Fry the pancetta. Meanwhile, heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan. When hot, tip in 200g smoked pancetta cubes or chopped streaky bacon. Fry over a medium heat until the fat in the meat has melted down into the pan and the meat has turned lightly golden. Be careful not to crisp the pancetta too much; it will be cooked a little bit more later on in the recipe. Remove from the heat and set aside.


3 - Prepare the sauce. Crack 2 of the eggs into a mixing bowl. Separate the yolk from the third egg: gently crack the side of the shell and, using both hands, slowly open it into two halves over a separate bowl - you want to keep the yolk in one of the halves. Tip the yolk from one shell half to the other and repeat until all the egg white has fallen into the bowl below, taking care not to crack the yolk on any rough shell edges. Tip the yolk in with the other eggs and beat together, along with 75ml double cream, 50g finely grated Grana Padano or parmesan cheese and some seasoning.

4 - Combine the dish. Add 2 crushed garlic cloves to the pancetta and return frying pan to hob. Fry over high heat for 1 min or until garlic is cooked and pancetta warmed through. Meanwhile, drain spaghetti. Tip back into the hot saucepan off the heat. Pour egg mixture over pasta, followed by hot pancetta, garlic, any fat and oils. Toss quickly and thoroughly with spaghetti spoon or tongs. Mix until it has thickened to a smooth, creamy sauce. Serve with extra cheese and freshly ground pepper
